### How to build a brain

I am interested in how to build a brain. Fortunately, the instructions on building a brain are written molecularly in the genome, and so my research focuses on deciphering these instructions by uncovering the different molecules and strategies that neurons in the brain use to connect with each other. This will then help us understand how these wiring instructions can go awry in abnormal brain development.
