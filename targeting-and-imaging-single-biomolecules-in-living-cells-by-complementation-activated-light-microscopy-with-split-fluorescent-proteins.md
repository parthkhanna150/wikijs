# Targeting and imaging single biomolecules in living cells by complementation-activated light microscopy with split-fluorescent proteins


### Abstract
Single-molecule (SM) microscopy allows outstanding insight into biomolecular mechanisms in cells. However, selective detection of single biomolecules in their native environment remains particularly challenging. Here, we introduce an easy methodology that combines specific targeting and nanometer accuracy imaging of individual biomolecules in living cells. In this method, named complementation-activated light microscopy (CALM), proteins are fused to dark split-fluorescent proteins (split-FPs), which are activated into bright FPs by complementation with synthetic peptides. Using CALM, the diffusion dynamics of a controlled subset of extracellular and intracellular proteins are imaged with nanometer precision, and SM tracking can additionally be performed with fluorophores and quantum dots. In cells, site-specific labeling of these probes is verified by coincidence SM detection with the complemented split-FP fusion proteins or intramolecular single-pair FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer. CALM is simple and combines advantages from genetically encoded and synthetic fluorescent probes to allow high-accuracy imaging of single biomolecules in living cells, independently of their expression level and at very high probe concentrations.
